# C4TS-Floater
After our first successful mission of trying to discover the boundaries of the sky, we came back for a new challenge.This time sround we decided to make a longer and more stabilized flight. The floater that we intend to launch, will be flying at around 15-20km in altitude, collecting various information about the surrounding environment.Following the book "Around the world in 80 days" by Jules Verne, we decided to bring the story back to life.
